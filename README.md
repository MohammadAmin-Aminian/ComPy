# ComPy: Seafloor Compliance Analysis Tool

Overview

ComPy is a specialized software tool designed for the automated processing and analysis of seafloor compliance data. It enhances the precision of subsurface shear velocity models using Broadband Ocean-Bottom Stations data from the Indian Ocean. ComPy is tailored to manage extensive data processing steps, ensuring high resolution and accuracy in geological analysis.

Features

Automation of data pre-processing steps including glitch removal, tilt effect minimization, and pressure gauge calibration.
Implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for robust depth-velocity inversion.
Utilization of advanced signal processing techniques to handle seafloor compliance data.
Installation

Before installing ComPy, ensure you have Python and the necessary packages installed. ComPy requires Python 3.x.

bash
Copy code
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/ComPy.git

# Navigate to the ComPy directory
cd ComPy

# Install required Python packages
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy obspy tiskitpy
Usage

Here's how you can use ComPy to process your seafloor compliance data:

python
Copy code
import compy

# Example of loading data and running the main processing function
data = compy.load_data('path/to/your/datafile')
results = compy.process_data(data)

# Example of plotting results
compy.plot_results(results)
Required Libraries

Make sure these libraries are installed:

numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For plotting data.
scipy: For scientific and technical computing.
obspy: For processing seismological data.
tiskitpy: Custom library for additional processing tools (ensure correct installation).
Data Format

Ensure that your input data conforms to the expected format detailed in the data_format.md. This might include specific file types or data structures essential for processing.

Configuration

Adjust the settings in config.yaml for specific analysis requirements, such as analysis windows, frequency bands, and other parameters critical to the compliance analysis.

Examples

For more detailed usage examples, refer to the examples directory. These examples provide step-by-step guides on how to prepare your data, set configuration options, and visualize the output of ComPy.
