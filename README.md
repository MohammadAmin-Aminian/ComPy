# Overview

ComPy is a specialized software tool designed for the automated processing and analysis of seafloor compliance data. It enhances the precision of subsurface shear velocity models using Broadband Ocean-Bottom Stations data from the Indian Ocean. ComPy is tailored to manage extensive data processing steps, ensuring high resolution and accuracy in geological analysis.

# Features

Automation of data pre-processing steps including glitch removal, tilt effect minimization, and pressure gauge calibration.
Implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for robust depth-velocity inversion.
Utilization of advanced signal processing techniques to handle seafloor compliance data.

# Installation

Before installing ComPy, ensure you have Python and the necessary packages installed. ComPy requires Python 3.x.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/ComPy.git

# Navigate to the ComPy directory
cd ComPy

# Install required Python packages
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy obspy tiskitpy

# Usage

Here's how you can use ComPy to process your seafloor compliance data:

import compy

rotated_stream,azimuth,angle,variance = compy.Rotate(stream_decim,time_window = 1)

**Function Overview:**
The `compy.Rotate` function rotates seismic data to minimize tilt effects and removes coherence noise, enhancing data accuracy for compliance analysis. The default processing window is set to 1 hour but can be adjusted as needed.

- **rotated_stream**: The seismic data stream after rotation and noise removal.
- **azimuth**: The direction of the rotation applied to correct the tilt in degrees.
- **angle**: The angle of tilt correction applied to the seismic data.
- **variance**: The reducted variance ratio (After/Before), indicating the effectiveness of noise reduction.
